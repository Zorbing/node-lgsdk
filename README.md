import * as lgsdk from 'node-lgsdk';


let counter = 0;

const lcdInstance = lgsdk.LogiLcd.getInstance();
if (!lcdInstance.initialized)
{
	lcdInstance.init('Example');
}
function showCounter()
{
	lcdInstance.setText([
		'G-Key with even number press-',
		'ed ' + counter + ' times',
	]);
	lcdInstance.update();
}
showCounter();

const gkeyInstance = lgsdk.LogiGkey.getInstance();
if (!gkeyInstance.initialized)
{
	gkeyInstance.init();
}
gkeyInstance.addEventListener('keyDown', (event) =>
{
	if (event.keyIdx % 2 === 0)
	{
		counter++;
		showCounter();
	}
});

process.stdin.resume();
